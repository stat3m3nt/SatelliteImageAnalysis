# SatelliteImageAnalysis - Land Detection
This project analyzes satellite images to detect land vs water areas for environmental and urban applications. It demonstrates two approaches:

1. **Java** - Use of dynamic programming to count all square land regions in a binary matrix.
2. **Python** - Use of OpenCV and NumPy to segment and visualize land and water

## **Features**
- Converts satellite images to binary form (land vs water)
- Count the number of square land regions (Java dynamic programming approach)
- Visualize segmented images (Python image processing approach)
- Output statistics for land/water

## Real-life Application
- **Agriculture:** Distinguish water bodies and land ares for better management.
- **Disaster assessment:** Analyze water coverage to identify flood-prone areas.
- **Urban planning/Construction:** Identify available land for development.
